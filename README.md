## Project Overview

AgriSenti is a comprehensive agricultural assistance web application designed for farmers across Kenya. The platform leverages modern technology to address key challenges faced by local farmers, including limited access to agricultural expertise, difficulty in identifying crop diseases, and lack of market information.

Developed to bridge the information gap in Kenya's agricultural sector, AgriSenti integrates multiple tools that help farmers optimize their agricultural practices, monitor crop health in real-time, track market prices for better decision-making, and receive personalized farming recommendations based on local conditions. The application is designed with a user-friendly interface that considers the varying technical literacy levels of farmers in the region.
